# Readme

I am a complete Phaser 3, JavaScript and TypeScript noob, and really struggled with the official [Making your first Phaser 3 game](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1) guide, as I want to use TypeScript.

After a few days of reading tutorials and asking on Discord, I finally managed to convert it and get it working. A proud moment.

Because I am not the onliest noob alive, I share my code with you all. Maybe it saves you some headaches.

To start write `npm i` to install and then `npm start` to run the game.

My Highscore is 570. Can you beat it? :)

Just to make it clear: This is not an official guide and I am not affiliated with Phaser/Photonstorm in any way or form

Update: Apparently there is also a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXxmSbfR2aY) for the aforementioned tutorial. I feel pretty stupid now.

Update2: I went, cleaned, commented and refactored my code based on the video guide. Cheers!
